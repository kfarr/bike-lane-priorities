## What is this list?
This is an attempt to force rank which bicycle infrastructure improvements should be implemented in San Francisco.

## Why this list?
There are many supporters of bike infrastructure improvement but not all align on which specific projects are important relative to each other.

This misalignment can impact infrastructure building in a few ways:
- Leads to "squeaky wheel syndrome" where a loud minority get attention
- Improvements are often reactionary related to specific high-profile incidents instead of proactive
- General low productivity as efforts are splintered on different projects by each city agency, advocacy organization and even the general public.

Further, there is no forum for stakeholders outside of City agencies to see technical details of projects and a "source of truth" of current and proposed conditions.

Instead, this approach attempts to use a simple rubric to prioritize projects which is open and can change based on community discussion. This approach also attempts to be a central repository for all persons (whether or not affiliated with the City) to update factual information of various projects based on current conditions and proposed new projects.

## Project Prioritization Rubric:
* Feasibility - Level of effort for (protected) relative to current conditions (Includes: removal of parking, thru lanes, physical constraints, road width, utilities, transit lanes and tracks, overhead wires.) Projects may rank more favoribly as being feasible if they are in progress or otherwise have a quick path to completion. 
* Data - Injury (collision, fatality), ridership, ratio (ie low ridership::high injury), user surveys or votes, modeling (estimating future ridership)
* Closing the Gaps - Network Connection (System Utility)

## How do you think bike lane projects should be prioritized in San Francisco?
Open a new issue: https://github.com/kfarr/bike-lane-priorities/issues

## What is done? What allows an item to be removed from the list?
It must be a useable fully protected bike path. This is most likely satisfied with a sufficiently wide bike lane buffered by parking, continuous safe-hit style delineators, or otherwise permanent physical barriers such as concrete or planters.

Projects that are in progress but incomplete remain on the list. It is not done until there are no cars parked on the lane and it provides a continuous safe travel path for people on bicycles on the duration of the project scope.
