What is this list?
This is an attempt to force rank which bicycle infrastructure improvements should be implemented in San Francisco.

Project Prioritization Rubric:
* Feasibility - Level of effort for (protected) relative to current conditions (Includes: removal of parking, thru lanes, physical constraints (road width, utilities), transit lanes and tracks, overhead wires
* Data - Injury (collision, fatality), ridership, ratio (ie low ridership::high injury)
* Network Connection - System Utility
* Modeling - Expected future ridership
