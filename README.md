## What is this list?
This is an attempt to force rank which bicycle infrastructure improvements should be implemented in San Francisco.

## Why this list?
There are many supporters of bike infrastructure improvement, but not all align on which specific projects are important relative to each other.

This can lead to "squeaky wheel syndrome" where a loud minority get attention, reactionary improvements always following a tragedy, and generally low productivity as efforts are scattered and resources are not unified.

Further, there is no forum for stakeholders outside of City agencies to see technical details of projects and a "source of truth" of current and proposed conditions.

Instead, this approach attempts to use a simple source project prioritization rubric which is open and can change based on community discussion.

## Project Prioritization Rubric:

* Feasibility - Level of effort for (protected) relative to current conditions (Includes: removal of parking, thru lanes, physical constraints, road width, utilities, transit lanes and tracks, overhead wires)
* Data - Injury (collision, fatality), ridership, ratio (ie low ridership::high injury), user surveys or votes, modeling (estimating future ridership)
* Closing the Gaps - Network Connection (System Utility)
